**Question 1:**
Write a function called solution(data, n) that takes in a list of less than 100 integers and a
number n, and returns that same list but with all of the numbers that occur more than n times
removed entirely. The returned list should retain the same ordering as the original list - you 
don't want to mix up those carefully-planned shift rotations! For instance, if data was [5, 10,
15, 10, 7] and n was 1, solution(data, n) would return the list [5, 15, 7] because 10 occurs 
twice, and thus was removed from the list entirely.
